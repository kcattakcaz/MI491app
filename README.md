**Android Instant Messaging App

This is an app I created for my MI 491 final project, and I have continued developing it.  The name
is pretty self explanatory, it allows users to participate in conversations and to exchange messages
and files through the Firebase and Amazon S3 SDKs.  Presently, I'm refactoring it to use Fragments
instead of Activities, and to provide responsive layouts for different device types and orientations,
as well as improving the app to provide some important features, such as taking photos using the camera,
providing notifications for new messages even if the app is not in the foreground.
